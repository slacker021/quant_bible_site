# Namespaces
Julia's design patterns are fundamentally built upon its _type system_ and _multiple dispatch_ paradigm. The language makes extensive use of _namespaces_ to isolate fragments of code, allowing independent components to be developed and maintained without causing symbol collisions.

> [!question]+ Application: Namespace Conflicts 
>  Namespaces resolve ambiguity when two distinct components share identical identifier names. Although the variable or function names are identical, their isolation within separate namespaces ensures they remain entirely distinct entities in memory.
> 
> ```Julia
> using StockPortfolio
> using UserProfile
> 
> # Both bindings contain names, but each belongs to a distinct namespace.
> company_name = StockPortfolio.name 
> user_name = UserProfile.name 
> ```
> 
> In the code sample above, the prefix preceding the binding designates the target namespace.

### Modules
Namespaces in Julia are declared using _modules_, which are designed to make code reusable, encapsulated, and distributable within packages. A module boundary is declared using the `module` keyword:
```Julia
module ModuleName # Start of the module definition

    # Module implementation details

end # End of the module definition
```
Elements defined within a module—such as variables, composite types, and functions—can be exposed to external scopes using the `export` or `public` keywords. Accessing bindings across module boundaries requires navigating the lexical namespace hierarchy using relative or absolute path resolution.

##### No Dots: Absolute Package Resolution
When the `using` or `import` keyword is invoked without leading dots, Julia performs a top-level absolute search:
```Julia
using ModuleName
using PackageName
```
- **The Mechanism:** The package manager (`Pkg`) search path (`LOAD_PATH`) or active project environment is queried for an independent, registered package or standard library module.
- **The Constraint:** Absolute resolution cannot locate a local submodule defined inside an arbitrary workspace file unless that directory has been initialized and activated as a formal package environment.

##### One Leading Dot: Current Scope Search
A single leading dot initiates a relative search starting strictly from the **current active module context**:
```Julia
using .ChildModule
```
- **The Mechanism:** The compiler searches strictly _downward_ within the currently executing module scope to locate a nested or included child module.
- **The Use Case:** Single-dot syntax is required within a parent orchestrator module (or at the `Main` REPL prompt) after an external file containing a submodule has been evaluated into that specific module scope via `include()`.

##### Two Leading Dots: Parent Scope Search
Two leading dots instruct path resolution to step exactly **one level up** the lexical module hierarchy:
```Julia
module SubModule
    using ..SiblingModule
end
```
- **The Mechanism:** The compiler exits the current submodule scope, steps upward into the enclosing parent module scope, and searches for the target module binding there.
- **The Use Case:** This is the standard pattern used by sibling submodules to reference shared types or utility submodules defined within a common parent container module.

##### Three Leading Dots: Grandparent Scope Search
Three leading dots step exactly **two levels up** the lexical hierarchy:
```Julia
module ParentModule
    module SubModule
        module DeepSubModule
            using ...SiblingModule
        end
    end
end
```
- **The Mechanism:** The compiler exits `DeepSubModule` and its immediate parent `SubModule` to search inside `ParentModule` for the target binding.

The standard architectural pattern in Julia decouples physical file loading (`include`) from namespace resolution (`using`). Evaluating `include("file.jl")` directly inside multiple submodules causes Julia to parse and evaluate the source code multiple times, generating distinct module instances with non-interoperable types.

To prevent type fragmentation, a single **parent container file** includes all source files into one parent module scope. Sibling submodules then utilize relative double-dot searching (`using ..ModuleName`) to access shared types.

> [!warning]+ Warning Recursive File Calls
> Avoid Recursive File Inclusions Calling `include()` inside submodules to load prerequisite submodules creates isolated, duplicate module instances. In Julia's type system, types defined in duplicate module instances (e.g., `ModuleA.Location.Widget` and `ModuleB.Location.Widget`) are treated as distinct, incompatible concrete types, causing `MethodError` exceptions during runtime dispatch.

> [!warning]+ 
> Module Scope Isolation Modules encapsulate their internal environments. Bindings imported into an outer or top-level scope are not automatically visible inside a child module scope. Required dependencies must be explicitly declared within the module body via `using` or `import`.

# Package Generation

### Packages
Julia enables multiple modules residing in a project directory to be bundled into a standardized unit called a _package_. Industrial-grade development utilizes the standard library/third-party package `PkgTemplates.jl` to establish standard directory layouts, automated testing suites, continuous integration workflows, and licensing metadata.

In modern versions of `PkgTemplates.jl` (v0.7+), package generation is invoked by instantiating a `Template` object and executing it as a functor:
```Julia
using PkgTemplates

template = Template(; kwargs...)
template("PackageName")
```

> [!example]- Example: Package Template Generation 
> Below is an automated template generation invocation executed within a developer session:
> ```Julia
> using PkgTemplates
> 
> template = Template(; 
>     user = "babybaby123", 
>     authors = ["Steve Jobs <steve.jobs@apple.com>"], 
>     julia = v"1.12", 
>     plugins = [
>         License(; name="MIT"),
>         Git(; manifest=true, ssh=true),
>     ]
> )
> 
> template("Calculator")
> ```
> 
> Generated package repositories are created by default in the environment development path `~/.julia/dev/`.
### Public API and Modern `public` Keyword
Julia 1.11 introduced the `public` keyword to distinguish symbols that form part of a package's stable API from those that are exported directly into a caller's workspace.
- **Exported Symbols (`export`):** Brought directly into the caller's active namespace upon invoking `using ModuleName`.
- **Public Symbols (`public`):** Classified as stable public API bindings without populating the caller's namespace upon invoking `using ModuleName`. Accessing public unexported symbols requires explicit qualification (`ModuleName.symbol`).
- **Private Symbols:** Internal implementation details subject to breaking changes without SemVer deprecation warnings.

It is a syntax error to mark a binding as both `public` and `exported`. Symbol status can be programmatically queried via `Base.ispublic`:
```Julia
module FinancialCalculator

    export interest, rate
    public amortize_loan

    interest(amount::Float64, rate::Float64) = amount * (1.0 + rate)
    rate(amount::Float64, total_interest::Float64) = total_interest / amount
    amortize_loan(principal::Float64, rate::Float64, periods::Float64) = principal * (rate / periods)

    _validate_inputs(amount) = amount > 0 || throw(ArgumentError("Value must be positive"))

end
```

> [!example]- Example: 
> It is a syntax error to mark a binding as both `public` and `exported`. Symbol status can be programmatically queried via `Base.ispublic`:
> ```Julia
> module FinancialCalculator
> 
> 	export interest, rate

> 	
> 	interest(amount::Float64, rate::Float64) = amount * (1.0 + rate)
> 	rate(amount::Float64, total_interest::Float64) = total_interest / amount 
> 	amortize_loan(principal::Float64, rate::Float64, periods::Float64) = principal * (rate / periods)
> 	
> 	_validate_inputs(amount) = amount > 0 || throw(ArgumentError("Value must be positive))
> 	
> end
> ```
> Consuming Exported and Public Symbols Below is an entry-point script evaluating `FinancialCalculator`:
> ```Julia
> include("FinancialCalculator.jl")
> using .FinancialCalculator # Single dot lookup for module loaded into Main
> 
> # Calling exported symbols without qualification
> simple_interest = interest(100_000.0, 0.05)
> interest_rate = rate(100_000.0, 25_000.0)
> 
> # Calling public unexported symbols requires explicit qualification
> amortized_loan = FinancialCalculator.amortize_loan(100_000.0, 0.05, 10.0)
> 
> println("Simple Interest: ", simple_interest)
> println("Interest Rate: ", interest_rate)
> println("Amortized Loan: ", amortized_loan)
> ```

### Conflict Resolution and Renaming

When identical identifiers are exported by separate packages, loading both into a single scope causes a namespace collision. Julia flags these collisions upon first usage. Julia 1.6 introduced the `as` keyword to establish local aliases during import:
```Julia
using Calculator: rate as calc_rate
using Rater: rate as rating_score

# Identifiers execute without namespace collisions
rate_1 = calc_rate(100.0, 5.0)
rate_2 = rating_score("Hands-On Design Patterns")
```

> 
> - `using ModuleName`: Loads the module and brings all `export`-declared symbols into the active namespace.
> - `using ModuleName: symbol`: Brings only the specified `symbol` into the active namespace.
> - `import ModuleName`: Loads the module without populating the active namespace with exported symbols; bindings must be qualified (`ModuleName.symbol`).
> - `import ModuleName: symbol`: Brings `symbol` into the active scope while granting permission to extend its methods via new dispatch definitions.

# Dependency Management and Project Environments

### Semantic Versioning and Project Manifests
Julia's package manager (`Pkg`) manages reproducible environments through two foundational configuration files:
- **`Project.toml`:** Declares top-level project metadata, direct dependencies, and version compatibility bounds (`[compat]`).
- **`Manifest.toml`:** Records the exact resolution graph of all direct and transitive dependencies, including exact commit hashes and version state.

Julia 1.11 introduced version-tagged manifests (e.g., `Manifest-v1.11.toml`), enabling distinct Julia runtime binaries to maintain isolated dependency graphs without corrupting shared project environments: 
```Julia
[compat]
julia = "1.12"
ExamplePackage = "1.2, 2.0"
```

### Circular Dependencies
The acyclic dependency principle dictates that module dependency graphs must remain directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Bidirectional or circular dependencies (`ModuleA` requiring `ModuleB` while `ModuleB` requires `ModuleA`) block static analysis, precompilation, and thread safety. Circular dependencies are resolved by factoring shared structures or interfaces out into a independent third module.

---
# Modern Type Design: Abstract, Concrete, and Union Types

### Abstract Type Hierarchies
Abstract types construct the structural taxonomy of Julia's nominal type system. Abstract types cannot be instantiated directly and contain no physical data fields. They establish shared behaviors and type bounds for multiple dispatch. Subtyping is declared using the `<:` operator:

```Julia
abstract type AbstractTypeName end
abstract type SubAbstractName <: AbstractTypeName end
```

> [!example]- Example: Asset Classification Hierarchy
> 
> ```Julia
> module FinancialAssets
> 
>     export Asset, Cash, Equity, FixedIncome, Derivative
> 
>     abstract type Asset end
>     abstract type Cash <: Asset end
>     abstract type Equity <: Asset end
>     abstract type FixedIncome <: Asset end
>     abstract type Derivative <: Asset end
> 
> end
> ```

### Introspecting Type Hierarchies
Type relationships can be programmatically inspected using functions exported by `InteractiveUtils`:
```Julia
using InteractiveUtils

supertype(Float64) # Returns AbstractFloat
subtypes(Asset)    # Returns Vector of immediate subtypes
```

### Struct Mutability and Partial Mutability
Concrete composite types are declared with `struct` and are immutable by default. Fields cannot be reassigned after construction, enabling the compiler to allocate instance memory on the stack rather than incurring heap-allocation overhead.

> [!example]+ Example: Mutable Structures
> Mutable structures are declared using `mutable struct`. Julia 1.8 introduced **partial mutability**, allowing specific fields within a `mutable struct` to be declared permanently immutable using the `const` keyword:
>```Julia
>module StockPrice
>	export CommonStock
>	
>	mutable struct CommonStock
>		const ticker::String
>		const full_name::String
>		price::Float64
>		const class::String
>	end
>end
>```

### Runtime Type Redefinition
Prior to Julia 1.12, redefining a composite structure within an active REPL session raised an error requiring a process restart. Julia 1.12 introduced dynamic struct redefinition backed by the internal _world age_ mechanism. Redefining a struct binding updates the symbol for subsequent evaluations while preserving existing instances in their historical world age contexts.

### Union Types and Optionals
A `Union` type represents an abstract type formed by the set-theoretic union of multiple types (`Union{T1, T2, ...}`). Handling missing or uninitialized values is commonly modeled by wrapping target types in `Union{T, Nothing}`: 
```Julia
# Declarative syntax
value::Union{Int64, Nothing} = nothing
```

---
# Advanced Parametric Types, Conversions, and Argument Fixing

### Parametric Composites and Abstract Invariance
Parametric types enable structures and functions to specialize based on type parameters. Parametric types in Julia are **invariant**: even though `Float64 <: Real`, `Vector{Float64}` is **not** a subtype of `Vector{Real}` (`Vector{Float64} <Path: Vector{Real}` evaluates to `false`). Invariance guarantees contiguous memory representation for numeric vectors, preventing pointer boxing overhead.

>[!example]- Example: Stock Portfolio
>```Julia
>struct StockHolding{T <: Integer, P <: Real}
>    symbol::String
>    quantity::T
>    price::P
>    market_value::P
>end
>```

### Modern Array Implementations and `Memory{T}`
Julia 1.11 refactored the foundational `Array` stack by introducing `Memory{T}`—a contiguous, fixed-length primitive buffer managed directly in pure Julia rather than C runtime wrappers. Modern multidimensional `Array` structures are built on top of `Memory{T}`, reducing allocation latency and enhancing garbage collection tracking.

### Coercion Rules and Typed Globals
Type coercion is executed via `convert(T, value)`. Julia avoids implicit automatic conversion except across strict language evaluation boundaries:
- Assigning values into typed array elements.
- Assigning values to composite structure fields.
- Returning values from functions with explicit return type annotations (`function f()::Float64`).
- Assigning to typed global variables (`global_var::Float64 = 100`).
```Julia
# Explicit type conversion syntax
x_int = 42
x_float = convert(Float64, x_int) # 42.0
```

### Argument Fixing with the Unified `Fix` Type
Julia 1.12 replaced single-argument binders (`Fix1`, `Fix2`) with a generalized `Fix` type capable of fixing arbitrary positional arguments across multi-argument functions:
```Julia
# General syntax
Fix(function, fixed_value, argument_position)
```

> [!example]- Example: Positional Argument Binding
> ```Julia
> calc_interest(principal, rate, years) = principal * (1.0 + rate)^years
> 
> # Fix argument position 3 (years) to 5
> calc_5_years = Fix(calc_interest, 5, 3)
> 
> # Fix argument position 2 (rate) to 0.05
> calc_5_years_at_5pct = Fix(calc_5_years, 0.05, 2)
> 
> final_amount = calc_5_years_at_5pct(1000.0)
> println("Accrued Value: $(round(final_amount, digits=2))$")
> ```
